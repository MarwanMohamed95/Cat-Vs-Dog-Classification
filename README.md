# **Cat Vs Dog Classification**

In this project we will calssify between cats and dogs using two techniques:

    - The first one is by building the model from scratch.
    - The second one is by using transfer learning from pre-trained model like InceptionV3
In the second method we will notice alot of improvement in accuray in training and validation data.


### Some of training images:

### Data Augmentation:

- The importance of data augmentation technique is that it increases the amount of training data by modifying the existing training data's properties. For example, in image data, you can apply different preprocessing techniques such as rotate, flip, shear, or zoom on your existing images so you can simulate other data that the model should also learn from. This way, the model would see more variety in the images during training.
